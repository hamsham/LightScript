 *  
 *  The hashes can be referenced as such:
 *      'scriptHash_addNums' and 'scriptHash_strcat'

 *  And the factory methods are accessible like this:

/**
 *  @brief Function Definition for source files.
 *  
 *  The definition of functors MUST define how arguments will be mapped to
 *  native functions. For example, to use this, simply write as follows:
 *  
 *      LS_SCRIPT_DEFINE_FUNC(addNums, scriptVar_int, scriptVar_int) {
 *          LS_SCRIPT_PARAM(0, int) += LS_SCRIPT_PARAM(1, int);
 *      };
 *  
 *      LS_SCRIPT_DEFINE_FUNC(strcat, scriptVar_string, scriptVar_string, scriptVar_string) {
 *          LS_SCRIPT_PARAM(0, std::string) = LS_SCRIPT_PARAM(1, std::string) + LS_SCRIPT_PARAM(2, std::string);
 *      };
 *  
 *  Although a bit verbose, the process is actually quite painless once you get
 *  used to it. As shown above, functor arguments/parameters are accessible
 *  through both indices and types. In order to ensure that the proper types
 *  get used by a functor, make sure that the 'compile()' method is called and
 *  returns TRUE before running a functor.
 *  
 *  Finally, defining a functor using this macro enables linkage to the global
 *  factory methods. A functor can now be spawned in the following manner:
 *      ls::script::functor* pFunc;
 *      pFunc = ls::script::createScriptFunc(scriptHash_addNums);
 *      if (pFunc->compile()) {
 *          pFunc->run();
 *      }
 *      delete pFunc;
 *

 *  @brief Function Argument Accessibility
 *  
 *  Use this macro to access arguments/parameters when defining the functor.
 *  For example, use it like this:
 *  
 *      LS_SCRIPT_DEFINE_FUNC(addNums, scriptVar_int, scriptVar_int) {
 *          LS_SCRIPT_PARAM(0, int) += LS_SCRIPT_PARAM(1, int);
 *      };
 *  
 *      LS_SCRIPT_DEFINE_FUNC(strcat, std::string, std::, std::string) {
 *          LS_SCRIPT_PARAM(0, std::string) = LS_SCRIPT_PARAM(1, std::string) + LS_SCRIPT_PARAM(2, std::string);
 *      };
